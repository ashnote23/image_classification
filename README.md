we need to import the required libraries. We need:

Numpy — a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.


TensorFlow — a free and open-source software library for dataflow and differentiable programming across a range of tasks.


TensorFlow datasets — a collection of datasets ready to use, with TensorFlow or other Python ML frameworks.
